        <h1><marquee direction="up" scrollamount="1" scrolldelay="0" height="32">History</marquee></h1>
            <p>The history of video games is filled with events and earlier technology that paved the way for the advent of video games
            <br />It also includes games that represent direct steps in the evolution of computerized gaming, and lastly the development and release of video games themselves.</p>
        <h1><marquee direction="up" scrollamount="1" scrolldelay="0" height="32">Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device(1947)</marquee></h1>
            <p>The earliest known interactive electronic game was by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann on a cathode ray tube<br />
            The patent was filed on January 25, 1947 and issued on December 14, 1948<br />
            The game was a missile simulator inspired by radar displays from World War II. It used analog circuitry, not digital, to control the CRT beam and position a dot on the screen<br />
            Screen overlays were used for targets since graphics could not be drawn at the time.</p>
        <h1><marquee direction="up" scrollamount="1" scrolldelay="0" height="32">Bertie the Brain (1950)</marquee></h1>
             <p>A specially-built machine for play
             Showcasing artificial intelligence with customizable difficulty levels, it was put on display by Rogers Majestic at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition<br /> 
             Moves were entered on a keypad and displayed overhead.</p>
        <h1><marquee direction="up" scrollamount="1" scrolldelay="0" height="32">Nim (1951)</marquee></h1>
             <p>On May 5, 1951, the NIMROD computer, created by Ferranti, was presented at the Festival of Britain<br /> 
             Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively to play the game of Nim; this was the first instance of a digital computer designed specifically to play a game.<br /> 
             NIMROD could play either the traditional or "reverse" form of the game<br /> 
             It was based on an earlier Nim-playing machine, "Nimatron", designed by E.U<br /> 
             Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric in 1940 for display at the New York World's Fair, being patented the same year<br /> 
             "Nimatron" had been constructed from electromechanical relays and weighed over a ton.</p>
         <h1><marquee direction="up" scrollamount="1" scrolldelay="0" height="32">Strachey's Draughts Program (1951)</marquee></h1>
            hristopher Strachey developed a simulation of the game draughts for the Pilot ACE that ran for the first time on 30 July 1951 at NPL</p>
         <h1><marquee direction="up" scrollamount="1" scrolldelay="0" height="32">OXO / Noughts and Crosses (1952)</marquee></h1>
             <p>n 1952, Alexander S. Douglas made the first computer game to use an electronic graphical display<br />
             OXO, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a version of tic-tac-toe for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge<br />
             It was designed for the world's first stored-program computer, and used a rotary telephone controller for game control<br />
             There is a description of another "fun" program for EDSAC.</p>
         <h1><marquee direction="up" scrollamount="1" scrolldelay="0" height="32">Brown Box/Odyssey (1966)</marquee></h1>
             <p>In 1966, Ralph Baer resumed worked on an initial idea he had in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set<br />
             In May 1967, Baer and an associate created the first game to use a raster-scan video display, or television set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial<br />
             The "Brown Box", the last prototype of seven, was released in May 1972 by Magnavox under the name Odyssey. It was the first home video game console<br />
             Baer was involved in court battles over patents that spanned the 1970s and 1980s<br />
             These trials defined a video game as an apparatus that displays games by manipulating the video display signal of the raster equipment, such as a television set<br />
             Games prior to Odyssey did not use a video display, so did not qualify as such in the courts.</p>
